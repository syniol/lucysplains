# LucySplains! <sup><small>(Conversation with AI)</small></sup>
Welcome to 2023, where we expected to interact with an AI; well although; currently is 
in form of textual interaction by near future could be integrated with a functional machine.


## Quick Overview
In order to connect to OpenAI's platform please ensure you populated `OPEN_AI_KEY` inside 
`docker-compose.yml` with your own API keys. Follow commands in `Makefile` to get up & running
with tested environment.

Currently due to my precious time, I only produced CLI application, However, RESTful & GraphQL 
API could come in the near future. I personally use this CLI to experiment and examine ability of 
AI technology created by humans today.
